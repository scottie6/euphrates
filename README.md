Euphrates is a WebVR playground for BabylonJS. Out of the box, Euphrates implements the getting started example from the BabylonJS library. Jump right in to the source code and start adding meshes to your 3D canvas with JavaScript.

Euphrates is an extension of [knapsack](https://github.com/seanmross/knapsack). Knapsack is a simple Babel, Express, & Webpack server that transpiles and bundles ES2017 JavaScript for a quick and easy development experience.
